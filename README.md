# Analyzation of CICIDS2017

## Objective

The Analyzation of CICIDS2017 Project aimed to leverage the Elastic Stack to ingest and analyze network traffic flow data from the CICIDS2017 dataset. By utilizing Elasticsearch for data indexing and Kibana for visualization, the project focused on identifying and visualizing key indicators of malicious activity within network traffic.
This project enhanced understanding of SIEM concepts and the practical implementation of security monitoring and analysis components.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of network traffic flow analysis and visualization using Elastic.
- Skill in ingesting and processing large-scale datasets, such as the CICIDS2017 dataset, for security analysis.
- Proficiency in leveraging Elasticsearch for efficient data indexing and Kibana for detailed visualization of malicious activities.
- Skill in configuring SIEM-like functionalities with the Elastic Stack for comprehensive security monitoring.
- Developed strong analytical abilities for detecting and interpreting indicators of malicious activity within network traffic data.

### Tools Used

- Data Analysis and Visualization: Leveraged Elasticsearch for efficient data ingestion and indexing, and Kibana for creating interactive visualizations of malicious network traffic flow data points.
- Learning Resources: Referenced Elastic documentation and YouTube tutorials to gain insights and resolve specific technical challenges encountered during the project.
